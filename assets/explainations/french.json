In this case, the first vowel is replaced by an apostrophe, and the two words are no longer separated.\n\nExamples: \"ce est\" becomes \"c'est\", \"je ai\" becomes \"j'ai\", \"le animal\" becomes \"l'animal\", \"si il\" becomes \"s'il\", \"Lorsque on\" becomes \"lorsqu'on\"...\n\nWith the exception of verbs conjugated in the second person singular (tu), which retain their vowel.\n\nExamples: \"Tu es\", \"tu as\", \"tu imagines\"..."
